If you're reading this you somehow got the source code for Space
Voyage, and for that I congratulate you.

Welcome to Space Voyage!
    You are the captian of a ship plying vast streches of uninhabited
    space. Your goal is to navigate trecherous asteroid fields and
    make it to the next space station.

About Space Voyage:
    I created this game in the Fall of 2013 for an Advanced
    Computer Graphics and Game Design Class at LA Tech. The
    actual graphics portions were written in Winter 2012-2013.
    I had more fun than I thought possible making this game and
    I hope you enjoy it just as much as I did.
    Special thanks to Dr. Mike O'Neal.

Now I must warn you Space Voyage is very sparsely commented, so
good luck understanding what's going on.

Helpful code stuff:
	-The main method is in Game.java
	-make.bat cleans and rebuilds everything
	-log.txt is a log file that can be turned on in Game.java
		and written to using Game.java's log method
	-goJar.bat creates the executable jar using MANIFEST.MF

All the best,
Andrew Duryea
